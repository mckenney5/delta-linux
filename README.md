Delta Linux
===========
_An embedded-like Linux experience for distraction free programming_


## About
This is a collection of programs that I have slowly rewrote to make a simple Linux distro
to focus on programming. Ultimatly there will be a script that converts a Debian netinstall
to Delta.


## Programs
### Init
_sinit_ - A *very* simple init system that starts the bare minimum to start working, and watches over those programs.


### Bin-Utils
_slimcat_ - A POSIX compliant cat rewrite writren in under 60 lines of C.

*more coming _soon_(tm)*


## Project Meta
This software is in an *unfinished alpha* state. It currently does not fully work and is incomplete.


## How to Install
*not implemented _yet_*
